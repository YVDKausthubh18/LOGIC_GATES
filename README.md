# Logic_Gates
Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of digital circuits. They perform Boolean operations on one or more binary inputs (0 or 1) to produce a single binary output.  

Types of Logic Gates

ðŸ”² Basic Gates:
- AND Gate: Outputs `1` only if both inputs are `1`.  
- OR Gate: Outputs `1` if at least one input is `1`.  
- NOT Gate: Inverts the input (`0 â†’ 1`, `1 â†’ 0`).  

ðŸ”² Universal Gates: 
- NAND Gate (NOT AND): Opposite of AND; outputs `0` only when both inputs are `1`.  
- NOR Gate (NOT OR): Opposite of OR; outputs `1` only when both inputs are `0`.  

ðŸ”² Special Gates:
- XOR Gate (Exclusive OR): Outputs `1` when inputs are different.  
- XNOR Gate (Exclusive NOR): Opposite of XOR; outputs `1` when inputs are the same.
